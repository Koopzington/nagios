Security Aspects
----------------

If you consider the information about the TYPO3 instance gathered and provided by the extension as sensitive information, you may want to restrict access to the TYPO3 instance where the Nagios® extension is installed (there is a reason why TYPO3 does not reveal its full major/minor/release version as long as you are not logged in at the backend).

In most cases the Nagios® server is the only "client" that needs access to the information generated by the extension and therefore the extension allows you to limit the access as described in the next sections.
