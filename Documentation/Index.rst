The content of this document is related to TYPO3 CMS, a GNU/GPL CMS/Framework available from `www.typo3.org <http://www.typo3.org/>`_

Nagios® was originally developed by Ethan Galstad and is licensed under the GNU GPL V2.

No parts or components of Nagios® are used in the TYPO3 extension described in this document. However, this extension makes no sense without a Nagios® server (and the "check\_typo3" plugin) which retrieves the information generated by the extension, interprets the data and reacts appropriately.

Read more about Nagios® and its license at `http://www.nagios.org <http://www.nagios.org/>`_

The Nagios® TYPO3 Monitoring extension (extension key: nagios) and the Nagios® plugin were developed by Michael Schams.

This documentation applies to version 1.2.11 of the Nagios® TYPO3 Monitoring extension.

Many thanks to Simon at Cerebrum for his support in creating the manuals, Tim for testing the extension, Christian for his contribution to support eID since version 1.2.0 and his valuable security advices regarding the proxy/cache setup. I would also like to thank Markus for his work in regards to the “disk usage check”.
