The content of this document is related to `TYPO3 CMS <http://typo3.org/>`_, an enterprise open source content management system, licensed under GNU/GPL.

Nagios® was originally developed by Ethan Galstad and is licensed under the GNU GPL V2. No parts or components of Nagios® are used in the TYPO3 extension described in this document. However this extension makes no sense without a Nagios® server (and the ``check_typo3.sh`` plugin) which retrieves the information generated by the extension, interprets the data and reacts appropriately.

This documentation applies to version 2.1.0 of the Nagios® TYPO3 Monitoring extension.


.. important::

   **TYPO3 Nagios Extension Version 1.2.x vs. 2.x.x:**

   Version 2.0.0 of the TYPO3 extension is a re-development from scratch using Extbase and modern PHP functions and methods. This version requires TYPO3 CMS 7.6.0 or newer. If you plan to use the Nagios extension in older versions of TYPO3 CMS, please use version 1.2.x of the extension.

   **Breaking Change in Version 2.1.x:**

   A change of the output format between ``EXT:nagios`` version 2.0.x and 2.1.x is a possible **breaking change** under certain circumstances. Please read :ref:`_update-from-2-0-x-to-2-1-x` for further details.
