Support

Community Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 is a community-driven project with a huge basis of developers. You can ask questions in one of the community areas (e.g. TYPO3 forum, mailing lists, on IRC, etc.). Find TYPO3 support options at: `http://typo3.org/support <http://typo3.org/support/>`_. Alternatively, feel free to contact the author of the TYPO3 extension directly `schams.net <https://schams.net/>`_ .

Commercial Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to address specific needs for ad-hoc support, maintenance or change requests, I offer commercial support, too. You can also sponsor the development or pay for a customized version which fully meets your individual requirements. Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss your requirements.

Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 inspires people to share! Nagios®, as well as the TYPO3 Nagios® Extension are published under the GNU GPL V2.

I would like to encourage you to get in touch with me, if you have any ideas or suggestions how to improve the extension (e.g. new features) or if you modified, updated, simplified, changed, extended the existing code. I am always happy to consider implementing changes in future versions of the extension (and some code suggestions have been merged in the past - thanks to all contributors!)

Sponsorship
^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the nature of this extension and the focus to support a large scale of infrastructure and TYPO3 servers it is likely that the extension is used in commercial environments. In order to address specific needs for ad-hoc support, maintenance or change requests, we offer commercial support. You are also welcome to sponsor the development or pay for a customized version which fully meets your individual requirements.

Read more about contributions, sponsorship options and commercial/non-commercial support at: `schams.net <https://schams.net/>`_. You may also want to consider to use the commercial version of Nagios®, see: `www.nagios.com <http://www.nagios.com/>`_.
