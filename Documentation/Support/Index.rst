Community Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 is a community-driven project with a huge basis of developers and integrators. You can ask questions about TYPO3 and TYPO3 extensions (including this extension) in one of the community areas (e.g. forums, mailing lists, on IRC or `Slack <https://typo3.slack.com>`_ etc.). For further TYPO3 support options, see: `https://typo3.org/support <https://typo3.org/support/>`_. Alternatively, feel free to contact the author of the TYPO3 extension directly, see `schams.net <https://schams.net/>`_ (or on Slack: ``@michael.schams``).

Commercial Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to address specific needs for ad-hoc support, maintenance or change requests, I offer commercial support, too. You can also sponsor the development or pay for a customized version which fully meets your individual requirements. Do not hesitate to contact me to discuss your requirements.

Contributions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

TYPO3 inspires people to share! Nagios®, as well as the TYPO3 Nagios® Extension are published under the GNU GPL V2.

I would like to encourage you to get in touch with me, if you have any ideas or suggestions how to improve the extension (e.g. new features) or if you modified, updated, simplified, changed, extended the existing code. I am always happy to consider implementing changes in future versions of the extension (and some code suggestions have been merged in the past - thanks to all contributors!)

The PHP source code is freely available at `https://github.com/schams-net/nagios <https://github.com/schams-net/nagios>`_.

Buy me a Beer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Due to the nature of this extension and the focus to support a large scale of infrastructure and TYPO3 servers it is likely that the extension is used in commercial environments. If you like my work and want to show some appreciation, you can **buy me a beer/pizza**. Get in touch with me and I am happy to send you my `PayPal ID <https://www.paypal.com>`_ for example.
